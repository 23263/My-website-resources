            The Serie A logo has evolved to balance tradition and modern identity. Earlier versions used circular shapes and the Italian flag’s colors to emphasize heritage. In 2019, it was redesigned into a bold, angular “A,” giving it a sharper and more dynamic look. This modern design enhances global branding while still honoring Italy’s football culture.

            <p>The Serie A officially known as Serie A Enilive in Italy and Serie A Made in Italy abroad for sponsorship reasons, is a professional association football league in Italy and the highest level of the Italian football league system. Established in the 1929–30 season, it restructured the existing Italian Football Championship, which had been played since 1898, into a national round-robin format alongside Serie B. It functions under a promotion and relegation system with Serie B.</p>

            <p>The league was organised by the Direttorio Divisioni Superiori until 1943, the Lega Calcio from 1946 to 2010, and the Lega Serie A ever since. The 29 championships played from 1898 to the formation of the Serie A in 1929 are officially recognised by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as equal to later Serie A titles. Similarly the 1945–46 season, played under a temporary format due to World War II, is also recognized as an official championship. Since 1924, the winner of Italy's top division has worn the scudetto emblem on its kit in the following season, and since 1961, the Coppa Campioni d'Italia trophy has been awarded to the Serie A champion.
</p>

            <p>Known for tactical discipline and defensive rigor, the Serie A has been consistently ranked among the strongest leagues in global football. As of 2024–25, Serie A ranks second in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, behind England's Premier League and ahead of Spain's La Liga.</p>

            <p>
                The Serie A is home to several of football's most successful and renowned clubs, including Juventus, Inter Milan, and AC Milan. These teams have played key roles in European football governance and competition history. Juventus, the most decorated club in Italy, has achieved international success across all major UEFA and intercontinental tournaments. Milan and Inter have also earned significant honors, with Milan joint-third among clubs for most UEFA titles, and Inter achieving a continental treble in 2009–10. Alongside Roma, Napoli, Lazio, and Fiorentina, these clubs form the "seven sisters" (sette sorelle) of Italian football. The Serie A has historically attracted top global talent, producing numerous Ballon d'Or winners.
