            The Premier League logo has evolved over time to reflect the league’s growth and modern identity. Early versions featured a full lion with a crown and football, symbolizing power and tradition. In 2016, the design was simplified to a bold lion’s head, creating a cleaner, more modern look that works across digital media and global branding while still honoring the league’s heritage.

            The Premier League trophy is one of the most famous awards in football and has been presented since the league’s start in 1992. Designed to symbolize victory and pride, it features a golden crown on top and a pair of lions as handles, with a third lion represented by the winning team’s captain when lifting it. The trophy has two identical copies so it can be awarded to the champions immediately, and its design has remained largely unchanged, preserving its iconic status in football history.
